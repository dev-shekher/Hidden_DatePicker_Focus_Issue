# Hidden_DatePicker_Focus_Issue
This sample application has been developed to demonstrate an issue with the DatePicker and TimePicker controls in the MAUI framework, specifically in version 8.0.x.

When the IsVisible property of a DatePicker or TimePicker control is set to False, and the control is programmatically focused through an external button's click event handler, the UI experiences an unexpected behavior. The content of the page gets pulled down and extra white space gets added. (see recording)
